## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project.

### Reporting Bugs

*   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ihuzaifashoukat/twitter-automation-ai/issues).
*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ihuzaifashoukat/twitter-automation-ai/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
*   Describe the **environment** in which you encountered the bug (e.g., Python version, OS, browser version if applicable).

### Suggesting Enhancements

*   Open a new issue to discuss your suggested enhancement. Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and its potential benefits.
*   Provide a clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
